# AI-BASED-SPACE-DEBRIS-AVOIDANCE-SYSTEM
AI-Based Space Debris Avoidance System is an educational simulation that uses real TLE data to track satellites and orbital debris, estimate collision risk with a machine-learning model, and execute fuel-aware avoidance maneuvers. The project demonstrates autonomous decision-making and space situational awareness concepts.
